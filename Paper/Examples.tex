% Distance computations using kernel from gputools
% Particle filter
In this section, we look at several examples and see how they perform
on various GPUs.  The first example is a simple scalar version of the
normal density function and we compare this with the highly efficient
\Rfunc{dnorm} function in base \R.  We also look at a similar example
involving importance sampling.  This is similar as it maps an
element-wise vectorized operation in \R{} to element-wise threads on a
GPU.  We then look at computing distances on a GPU by addapting code
in the \Rpkg{gputools} package.  This illustrates how we can use an
existing kernel and invoke it from \R{} without the supporting \C{}
code to interface from \R.
