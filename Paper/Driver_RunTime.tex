There are two CUDA APIs - driver and run-time.
When programming in C, the run-time presents a slightly higher level of abstraction
and simpler programming model. The driver API provides more control over some operations.
Importantly, the driver API allows us to dynamically load and unload modules.
Since we are running in an interactive R session, and not a single compiled program that runs
sequentially and terminates,  this ability to load and unload modules is essential.

Importantly, while the RCUDA package provides bindings to both APIs, 
the higher-level functions allow us to ignore the differences. % Rephrase.
