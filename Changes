Version 0.5-0

   *  .numericAsDouble in .cuda()/.gpu() now vectorized and works for scalars. 
      Issue identified by Chris Paciorek.

Version 0.4-0

   *  loadModule() can also load the PTX code directly. See isCode argument.

   *  Can pass R numeric() as double * in .gpu()/.cuda() calls via .numericAsDouble
      or via a global option CUDA.useDouble.

   *  cudaDoubleArray

   *  Enabled stream in .gpu()/.cuda(). See tests/streamUse.R

   *  Added async argument to .gpu()/.cuda()

   *  High-level mechanism for mallocPitch() and copying an R object to the memory.

   *  Regenerated the code with improvements to the code generation mechanism.

   *  Made functions returning CUdevice not decrement the value.
