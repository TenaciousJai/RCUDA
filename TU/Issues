Create the routines to copy structures.
   R_copyStruct_CUDA_ARRAY3D_DESCRIPTOR
   R_copyStruct_CUDA_ARRAY_DESCRIPTOR

[Done] cuda.createNativeProxy(r.cu$cudaArrayGetInfo)  gives bad code for copying
  back the structures.

Add a asRef argument when returning a struct.

Allow an integer() vector or a int pointer when an int * is expected.

[Done] cuArrayCreate takes a pointer for the result and another pointer to a struct
 describing the array.  The second is being treated as an output parameter
 If it were const, we'd be fine. 
    It actually is. So how is RCIndex losing this information.
 We can special case it, but it is a legitimate output variable in 
   cuArray3DGetDescriptor



[Done] cuMemHostGetDevicePointer  has a void * that is not an output variable.
   if const. 
   
[Done] cuMemcpyDtoH_v2  first arg is a pointer, but needs to be passed 
   can we use const?

[Done] cuMemFree needs a const. Should be  (void * const), but Clang seems to reverse the const. 
   See const.c - Does get it right for foo1

[Done] In cuMemHostGetFlags, outputting character() for setting the second element of the list, i.e. converting void *
  Will this go away with the const!

Put const on
   cudaSetValidDevices
 in cuda_runtime_api.h   - copied here. 
 * Could detect this with the fact that int len is the next parameter

These are okay w/o modifying signature.

  cuMemFreeHost

Do we care about the  interfaces:
 PCI?
 IPC?
