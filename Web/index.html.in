<h1>RCUDA - Bindings for R to the CUDA API</h1>

<p>

This R package is an interface to the CUDA API and libraries. It
allows R programmers to invoke code on a Nvidia (GP)GPU.
This gives extensive parallelism on ALUs.

<p/>

This package is similar to Simon Urbanek's <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenCL/">OpenCL</a>
package, but specifically targets CUDA and Nvidia.  These packages
provide the building blocks for people to use the GPUs from within R
in arbitrary ways. They allow one to write code in R that manipulates
the GPU.  This is different from packages such as gputools or rgpu
which provide R functions for particular algorithms which are
programmed in C and leverage the GPU through that C code.  OpenCL and
RCUDA aim to make writing that code feasible in R.  This is allows us
to use higher-level programming languages and also makes it much
easier to experiment with GPUs.

<h2>Plans</h2>
<p>
In the near future, we will complete the bindings by
programmatically generating the R and C code for each of the routines.
(The enums are already present, along with some of the structs, etc.)

<p> Also in the near future, we will connect the <a
href="../Rllvm">Rllvm</a> and <a
href="../RLLVMCompile">RLLVMCompile</a> packages with this so that we
can directly compile R functions to act as kernels on the GPU.
This will both make it easier to write kernels and remove
the need for nvcc (a reasonably trivial issue).

<h2>Examples</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> <a href="explorations/dnorm.R">normal density</a>
  <dd> This avoids excess memory by writing the results into the same
      vector as the inputs.

  <dt>
  <li> <a href="explorations/dnormOutput.R">normal density</a>
  <dd> This uses a separate input and output vector.

  <dt>
  <li> <a href="explorations/grid.R">grid.R</a>
  <dd> Exploring using different geometries or dimensions for the grid
     and blocks.
