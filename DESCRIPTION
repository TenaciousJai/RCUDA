Title: R Bindings for the CUDA Library for GPU Computing
Description: This is an R interface to the CUDA software development kit (SDK )
   and allows us to query and manipulate GPUs with R code. 
   We can invoke code on the GPU and transfer data to and from the GPU and CPU.
   It is similar to Simon Urbanek's OpenCL package. The idea is to be able
   execute code on the GPU from within R.
   This offers a high-level programming interface to use GPUs
   within R.  It will also offer a full set of bindings to the CUDA SDK
   so that others can experiment with different features of the SDK
   such as pinned memory, streams, events, and explore how to leverage
   these for greater performance.
   We have longer term goals which will allow us to compile (simple) R 
   code into GPU kernels and also compile code that refers to the
   CUDA routines that work on the host.  This is similar to libNVVM.
SystemRequirements: CUDA SDK(>= 5.0)
