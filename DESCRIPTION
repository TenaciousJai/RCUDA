Title: R bindings for CUDA library for GPU computing
Description: This package provides initial bindings to
   the CUDA library for working with GPUs. It is similar
   to Simon Urbanek's OpenCL package. The idea is to be able
   execute code on the GPU from within R.
   We have longer term goals which will allow us to compile (simple) R 
   code into GPU kernels and also compile code that refers to the
   CUDA routines that work on the host. 
SystemRequirements: CUDA SDK(>= 5.0)
