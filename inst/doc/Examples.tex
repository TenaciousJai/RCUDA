% Distance computations using kernel from gputools
% Particle filter
In this section, we look at several examples and see how they perform
on various GPUs.  The first example is a simple scalar version of the
normal density function and we compare this with the highly efficient
\Rfunc{dnorm} function in base \R.  The second example adapts a
function in the \Rpkg{gputools} package to compute the distances
between observations in two data sets.  This illustrates how we can
use an existing kernel and invoke it from \R{} without the supporting
\C{} code to interface from \R.  A third example implements a particle
filter via GPU computations.
