This RCUDA package provides a reasonably comprehensive interface to the CUDA SDK.
This allows one to work with a GPU via R code. We can invoke CUDA code on the GPU,
put data on the GPU and bring it back into R.  We have access to devices, contexts, streams, events,
and all of the CUDA concepts.

This is now updated to work with CUDA SDK 7.5.
